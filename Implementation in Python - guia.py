Implementation in Python from scratch
We will be using the popular Iris dataset for building our KNN model. You can download it from here.

# Importing libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import math
import operator
#### Start of STEP 1
# Importing data 
data = pd.read_csv("train.csv")
#### End of STEP 1

data.head() 


# Defining a function which calculates euclidean distance between two data points
def euclideanDistance(data1, data2, length):
    distance = 0
    for x in range(length):
        distance += np.square(data1[x] - data2[x])
    return np.sqrt(distance)

# Defining our KNN model
def knn(trainingSet, testInstance, k):
 
    distances = {}
    sort = {}
 
    length = testInstance.shape[1]
    
    #### Start of STEP 3
    # Calculating euclidean distance between each row of training data and test data
    for x in range(len(trainingSet)):
        
        #### Start of STEP 3.1
        dist = euclideanDistance(testInstance, trainingSet.iloc[x], length)

        distances[x] = dist[0]
        #### End of STEP 3.1
 
    #### Start of STEP 3.2
    # Sorting them on the basis of distance
    sorted_d = sorted(distances.items(), key=operator.itemgetter(1))
    #### End of STEP 3.2
 
    neighbors = []
    
    #### Start of STEP 3.3
    # Extracting top k neighbors
    for x in range(k):
        neighbors.append(sorted_d[x][0])
    #### End of STEP 3.3
    classVotes = {}
    
    #### Start of STEP 3.4
    # Calculating the most freq class in the neighbors
    for x in range(len(neighbors)):
        response = trainingSet.iloc[neighbors[x]][-1]
 
        if response in classVotes:
            classVotes[response] += 1
        else:
            classVotes[response] = 1
    #### End of STEP 3.4

    #### Start of STEP 3.5
    sortedVotes = sorted(classVotes.items(), key=operator.itemgetter(1), reverse=True)
    return(sortedVotes[0][0], neighbors)
    #### End of STEP 3.5


# Creating a dummy testset
testSet = [[7.2, 3.6, 5.1, 2.5]]
test = pd.DataFrame(testSet)
#### Start of STEP 2
# Setting number of neighbors = 1
k = 1
#### End of STEP 2
# Running KNN model
result,neigh = knn(data, test, k)

# Predicted class
print(result)
-> Iris-virginica
# Nearest neighbor
print(neigh)
-> [141]
 

Now we will try to alter the k values, and see how the prediction changes.

# Setting number of neighbors = 3 
k = 3 
# Running KNN model 
result,neigh = knn(data, test, k) 
# Predicted class 
print(result) -> Iris-virginica
# 3 nearest neighbors
print(neigh)
-> [141, 139, 120]

# Setting number of neighbors = 5
k = 5
# Running KNN model 
result,neigh = knn(data, test, k) 
# Predicted class 
print(result) -> Iris-virginica
# 5 nearest neighbors
print(neigh)
-> [141, 139, 120, 145, 144]
 

Comparing our model with scikit-learn
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
neigh = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=3)
neigh.fit(data.iloc[:,0:4], data['Name'])

# Predicted class
print(neigh.predict(test))

-> ['Iris-virginica']

# 3 nearest neighbors
print(neigh.kneighbors(test)[1])
-> [[141 139 120]]
